Tools For Tasks is a  mobile device web program that i created to help my dad keep track of what tools and materials he needs for different types of construction jobs. 

I came up with the idea by looking back to when i worked for my dad's Roofing business for around 7 years before transitioning into software development; 
and i noticed that we'd often forget materials or tools because every morning we had to load the truck and it would be hard to remember everything.

Tools for Tasks allows users to enter job name and notes, add  edit and delete tools and materials from the jobs and edit and delete jobs themselves.
This program consists of 3 objects(job, tool ,material) and 3 arrays(jobList, toolList, materialList) that keeps track of said objects and allow tool and material objects to be added to job objects. 
These arrays are stored and loaded from the web browsers local storage.
